# Welcome to The HEX Blog!

To all the seekers, the growers, the curious and the accidental link clickers - I bid you welcome. This blog is a complement to The Human Experiment Podcast - hosted by myself - Rajiv Menon - and my good friend Jacques Fu. We are a couple of seekers too - trying to find meaning, learning as we go and making as much of an impact as we can prior to our [impending death](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Memento_mori). 

This blog will contain further expositions, links to resources, random thoughts related to some of the topics that are covered in our podcasts. As you will see, we cover a lot of topics related to philosophy, mental models, current events, psychology, politics, decision-making, mindset, science, etc. 

## A gentle reminder while you are here

> **[The obstacle is the way](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Obstacle_Is_the_Way).** 
>
> Whatever you are struggling with, whatever you feel is preventing you from reaching your full potential, **that thing** is the ladder you must climb to become the true you. Therefore - Ascend, fellow space monkey! Lean in accept the mission you were given and [smile](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rzPNzJRe1kk). :) 

So please stay, explore, and visit us again soon for more posts, interviews and resources on our common journey as humans - collectively experimenting with our capabilities while being experimented on by the circumstances in our lives. 

Cheers!
